    "# Predicting Salary using Job Description text and Location data.\n",
    "In this notebook, I show how to predict salary using only the job description text and the job location.\n",
    "I used deep and wide network. I used Keras to build the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the description text part of data is not used in model building because it is a challenge to handel. But with neural network frameworks like tensorflow and keras, it is becoming more and more less of a challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to test how the description text will do on its own with just one other column. The results is exciting. I feel if I add the other features in the model, better results will be achieved. I will work on a part two and check the results.\n",
    "Data source: Kaggle.\n",

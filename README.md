# Predicting-Salary-using-Job-Description-text-and-Location-data
In this notebook, I show how to predict salary using only the job description text and the job location. I used deep and wide network. I used Keras to build the model.
Often the description text part of data is not used in model building because it is a challenge to handel. But with neural network frameworks like tensorflow and keras, it is becoming more and more less of a challenge. 
I decided to test how the description text will do on its own with just one other column. The results is exciting. I feel if I add the other features in the model, better results will be achieved. I will work on a part two and check the results. Data source: Kaggle.
